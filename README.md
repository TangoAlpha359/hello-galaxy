# hello-galaxy
Another repository by a human unit. <br>
This human unit is named Andrew. He is not very good at coding. He is learning. <br>
Andrew thinks galaxies are beautiful. He wishes he could travel among stars instead of remaining grounded on Earth. <br>
Since he cannot reach the stars, he wants to explore the strange new worlds of coding and data science to better understand things.
