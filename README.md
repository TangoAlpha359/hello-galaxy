# hello-galaxy
Another repository by a human unit.
This human unit is named Andrew. He is not very good at coding. He is learning.
Andrew thinks galaxies are beautiful. He wishes he could travel among stars instead of remaining grounded on Earth.
Since he cannot reach the stars, he wants to explore the strange new worlds of coding and data science to better understand things.
